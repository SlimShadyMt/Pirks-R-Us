# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

### 3. `requirements.txt`

To keep it super simple, you actually don’t *need* external packages, but let’s add `rich` just for nicer CLI output (optional).

```text
rich>=13.0.0python shady_generator.pypip install -r requirements.txtpython -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate# Slim Shady Playground

Welcome to the **Slim Shady Playground** – a tiny lab for experimenting with Shady‑inspired flows, personas, and text generation.

This project does **not** use or redistribute any real Eminem lyrics.  
Instead, it plays with **style, rhythm, and persona** using original, generated lines.

## Features

- 🔁 Simple "Slim Shady–inspired" line generator in Python
- 🎭 Command‑line persona mode that talks back in a chaotic alter‑ego voice
